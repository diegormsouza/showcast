Tropical Weather Discussion

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL

0015 UTC Wed May 28 2025



Tropical Weather Discussion for North America, Central America

Gulf of America, Caribbean Sea, northern sections of South

America, and Atlantic Ocean to the African coast from the

Equator to 31N. The following information is based on satellite

imagery, weather observations, radar and meteorological analysis.



Based on 1800 UTC surface analysis and satellite imagery through

2100 UTC.



...TROPICAL WAVES...



The axis of a tropical wave is along 47W from 03N to 14N moving 

west at 10 to 15 kt. Scattered moderate isolated strong convection

is ahead of the wave axis from 04N to 10N between 47W and 52W. 



A tropical wave is moving across the central Caribbean. Its axis

is along 73W, S of Haiti to northern Colombia. The wave is moving

at 10 to 15 kt. The wave appears to enhance convection over

northern Colombia and western Venezuela.



...MONSOON TROUGH/ITCZ... 



The monsoon trough enters the Atlantic near 13N17W and continues

SW to near 07N22W. The ITCZ continues from 07N22W to 06N45W. 

Scattered moderate convection is from 05N to 08N E of 15W to the

coast of Africa, and from 06N to 08N between 30W and 45W.



...GULF OF AMERICA...



A surface trough is analyzed over the NW Gulf while a surface 

ridge dominates the remainder of the basin. Scatterometer data

indicate fresh to strong NE to E winds behind the trough axis. 

A narrow band of showers and thunderstorms is associated with the

trough. Moderate to fresh SE winds are elsewhere W of 90W while  

mainly Light to gentle winds are over eastern Gulf. Seas are in 

the 3 to 6 ft range W of 90W, and 1 to 3 ft E of 90W. Visible 

satellite pictures showed smoke over the western Gulf, including

the Bay of Campeche, creating hazy conditions. Observations 

along the Mexican coast also confirmed the presence of hazy

conditions.



For the forecast, a surface ridge will prevail across the NE 

Gulf through Thu. The pressure gradient between this area of high

pressure and lower pressure over Mexico will support moderate to

fresh SE winds across the western half of the Gulf. Fresh to 

strong NE to E winds will pulse along and just north of the 

Yucatan Peninsula each afternoon and evening through Thu night as

a trough develops inland daily and then drifts westward to the 

Bay of Campeche at night. Smoke from agricultural fires in SE 

Mexico are expected to maintain hazy sky conditions across the 

Bay of Campeche and western Gulf through the end of the week. A 

weak cold front will move into the northern Gulf later this week.

The front will stall from central Florida to Texas during the 

weekend where it will gradually dissipate. 



...CARIBBEAN SEA... 



A ridge persists N of the area. The pressure gradient between 

this ridge, and the Colombian low is supporting fresh to strong 

winds over the south-central Caribbean. Moderate to fresh winds 

prevail elsewhere, except in the lee of Cuba where gentle to 

moderate winds are noted. Seas are in the 7 to 10 ft range over 

the south-central Caribbean, and 5 to 7 ft elsewhere S of 18N and

E of 82W. Seas of 3 to 5 ft are noted over the NW Caribbean with

the exception of 5 to 7 ft in the Gulf of Honduras.



As it is normal for this time of the year, convection has developed

over parts of the Greater Antilles due to daytime heating, local

sea breezes and mountain upslope lifting. Clear skies are offshore

Colombia and in the Gulf of of Honduras due to the stronger 

winds blowing there. Elsewhere, shallow moisture, embedded in the

trade wind flow is moving across the basin producing isolated to

scattered passing showers. 



For the forecast, pressure gradient between high pressure north of 

the region and the Colombian low will support fresh to strong NE 

to E winds and rough seas in the central, and portions of the 

southwest Caribbean through Sat night. Moderate to fresh trades 

are forecast for the majority of the remainder basin, except for 

pulsing fresh to strong winds in the Gulf of Honduras at night 

through Fri. 



...ATLANTIC OCEAN...



High pressure of 1030 mb located in the vicinity of the Azores 

dominates the Atlantic forecast waters. Its associated ridge 

extends SW toward the Bahamas and Florida. Light to gentle winds 

are along the ridge axis, with gentle to moderate winds elsewhere

N of 20N and W of 20W. South of 20N, moderate to fresh winds are

noted. Seas are in the 3 to 6 ft range N of 20N, and 6 to 8 ft S

of 20N. Transverse high clouds are observed across the Leeward 

Islands and regional Atlantic waters due to strong SW to W winds 

aloft. Farther E, the pressure gradient between the ridge and 

lower pressures over W Africa is resulting in fresh to strong 

northerly winds between the Canary Islands. fresh to strong N

winds are also noted from 18N to 23N between 17W and 22W. 



For the forecast west of 55W, the Atlantic subtropical ridge will 

persist from east to west along roughly 27N/28N through Fri night.

The pressure gradient between this area of high pressure and the

Colombian low will support moderate to fresh winds south of 25N.

Otherwise, a series of weak frontal troughs will sweep eastward 

across the waters north of the ridge and between northeast Florida

and Bermuda through Thu. Moderate to fresh SW winds are forecast

across the NE Florida offshore waters Thu night ahead of a cold 

front forecast to move off the northern Florida coast Fri night. 

The front will stall from 31N74W to NE Florida by Sat evening 

before dissipating late Sun. Locally strong SW winds are forecast

ahead of the front Fri night into Sat.
