Tropical Weather Discussion

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL

2205 UTC Tue May 27 2025



Tropical Weather Discussion for the eastern Pacific Ocean from

03.4S to 30N, east of 120W including the Gulf of California, and

from the Equator to 30N, between 120W and 140W. The following

information is based on satellite imagery, weather observations,

radar, and meteorological analysis.



Based on 1800 UTC surface analysis and satellite imagery through

2100 UTC.



...SPECIAL FEATURES...



Satellite imagery shows showers and thunderstorms becoming better 

organized near a broad area of low pressure located several hundred 

miles south of the coast of southern Mexico. Numerous moderate to

scattered strong convection is noted from 10N to 15N between 97W

and 105W. While the system still lacks a well-defined circulation,

environmental conditions are favorable for further development, 

and a tropical depression or tropical storm is expected to form 

tonight or on Wednesday as the low moves generally west-northwestward

at around 5 to 10 mph. There is a high chance of tropical formation

within the next 48 hours. Regardless of development, this system

will bring numerous showers and thunderstorms along with higher 

winds and seas to portions of the offshore waters from Oaxaca to 

Jalisco through late week. A Gale Warning has been issued in 

association with this developing system. 



Refer to the latest NHC Tropical Weather Outlook at 

www.hurricanes.gov, and the latest High Seas Forecast issued by 

the National Hurricane Center at website 

https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/MIAHSFEP2.shtml for more details



...INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE/MONSOON TROUGH...



The monsoon trough extends from 09N84W to a 1008 mb low pressure

located near 13N101.5W to 11N115W. The ITCZ axis continues from 

11N115W to beyond 07N140W. Aside from the convection associated 

with the low pressure located near 13N101.5W, scattered moderate

to isolated strong convection can be found from 14N to 16N 

between 92W and 97W, from 07N to 11N between 105W and 110W and 

from 05N to 10N between 118W and 131W.



...OFFSHORE WATERS WITHIN 250 NM OF MEXICO...



Please, see the Special Features section above for information 

on a low pressure located south of southern Mexico that is 

likely to develop into a tropical depression or tropical storm 

within the next 48 hours. 



A ridge, anchored by a 1025 mb high pressure centered near 34N132W,

extends over the Baja California offshore waters, reaching the 

Revillagigedo Islands. This system continues to support moderate 

to locally fresh NW winds west of the Baja California peninsula, 

with moderate seas. Mainly light and variable winds currently 

dominate the Gulf of California, the waters between Cabo Corrientes

and Los Cabos, and the coastal waters of the remainder of Mexico.

Over the outer offshore waters from Oaxaca to Michoacan, moderate

to fresh winds and moderate to rough seas are noted in association

with the development of a tropical system. 



For the forecast, the ridge will continue to dominate the offshore

forecast waters of Baja California through early Fri producing 

moderate to locally fresh NW winds, with moderate seas.



...OFFSHORE WATERS WITHIN 250 NM OF CENTRAL AMERICA, COLOMBIA, 

AND WITHIN 750 NM OF ECUADOR...



Recent satellite derived wind data indicate fresh NE winds across

the Papagayo region and downwind to about 87W. Elsewhere, light

to gentle winds, with moderate to locally rough seas in SW swell

prevail. Locally higher winds and seas are likely occurring near

the convective activity along the monsoon trough. 



For the forecast, high pressure N of the area combined with fresh to

strong trade winds across the south-central and SW Caribbean will

continue to support fresh to locally strong NE to E winds in the

Papagayo region and downwind to near 88W tonight and again Wed night.

Elsewhere, light to gentle winds will persist N of the monsoon trough,

with gentle to locally moderate S to SW winds prevailing to the S

of it through Fri. Long period SW swell will build across the offshore

forecast waters late this week, likely leading to rough seas south

of the Galapagos Islands by Fri into Sat. 



...REMAINDER OF THE AREA....



Please, see the Special Features section above for information 

on a low pressure located south of southern Mexico that is 

likely to develop into a tropical depression or tropical storm 

within the next 48 hours. 



High pressure of 1024 mb dominates most of the waters N of the 

ITCZ/Monsoon Trough and W of 110W while lower pressures persist E

of 100W related to the development of tropical cyclone. 

Gentle to moderate N to NE winds and moderate seas prevail under

the influence of the ridge, with some locally fresh NE trades N 

of the ITCZ to about 13N and W of 120. Otherwise, moderate or 

weaker winds and moderate seas prevail. 



For the forecast, high pressure will remain in control of the 

weather pattern across most of the forecast waters N of the 

ITCZ/Monsoon trough and W of 110W through late week as the high 

pressure center remains nearly stationary over the NW corner of 

the forecast region. This will support moderate to locally fresh 

trade winds mainly W of 130W. Farther south, a new set of long 

period SW swell will cross the equator on Wed, building seas to  

8 to 9 ft over most of the waters S of 10N between 100W and 122W

by late Fri.
